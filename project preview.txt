Name: Bootstrap 5 CDN Integration
Developer: Vasanthi Katta

Stack: HTML5, Bootstrap 5.3 (CDN), Bootstrap Icons, Formspree API1.
Project OverviewThe goal of this project was to create a functional, mobile-responsive website consisting of a Home Page, an About/Services Page, and a Working Contact Page. The project focused on rapid deployment using CDN (Content Delivery Network) methods rather than local installations to ensure high availability and speed.2. Key Features ImplementedSticky Navigation: A responsive Navbar that remains at the top of the viewport, featuring a "hamburger" menu for mobile users.Hero Component: A high-impact landing section using Bootstrap’s display typography and flexbox alignment.Grid-Based Features: A 3-column "Why Choose Us" section utilizing the row and col-md-4 classes for automatic stacking on smaller screens.Functional Contact Form: An integrated form using Bootstrap’s .form-control classes, connected to a third-party API (Formspree) for backend-less email delivery.Visual Consistency: Applied a unified color palette using Bootstrap’s utility classes like bg-primary, bg-dark, and text-muted.3. Technical Challenges & SolutionsChallengeSolutionMobile ResponsivenessUsed Bootstrap's 12-column grid system. By using col-lg-6 and col-md-4, the layout adapts from a single column on mobile to a multi-column layout on desktop.Backend ConnectivityInstead of writing complex PHP or Node.js code for the contact form, I implemented a POST method to a CDN-hosted API endpoint, allowing for a fully static site with dynamic capabilities.Load TimesUtilized jsDelivr CDNs with integrity hashes. This ensured the site stayed lightweight while maintaining high security and performance.4. Reflections & Personal GrowthEfficiency: I learned that Bootstrap’s utility classes (like py-5, shadow-sm, and mt-auto) significantly reduce the need for custom CSS files, speeding up the development cycle by roughly 60%.Component Logic: Understanding the difference between container and container-fluid was vital in managing the "white space" and readability of the content.Future Improvements: In the next version, I would like to implement Bootstrap SCSS to customize the default "Primary Blue" color to a more unique brand identity.5. ConclusionThis project successfully demonstrates the power of Bootstrap 5. By leveraging pre-built components and CDN delivery, I created a professional-grade interface that is accessible, performant, and ready for production.
